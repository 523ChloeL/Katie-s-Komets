  <h3>My Heroes- Chloe Lee</h3>
  <p>I have been interested in magic since I was a kid, but where did this come from?  I got my first magic kit around the age of 7, but didn't really get into it until I was 12 years old.  I started out with props, but now I can perform a few magic tricks and can do some cardistry.</p>

  <p>Obviously I was not able to see Harry Houdini while he was alive, but he still inspired me to get into magic through books I have read about him.  In elementary school, I actually enjoyed reading, and borrowed books every week to read up on Harry Houdini.  I learned how he was an escape artist and how he was able to escape jails, and small containers filled with water.  This exposure to the world of magic and illustion changed my life forever.</p>

  <p>When I was 7, my family and I went to Las Vegas, and one of the more memorable things that happened there was that we went to see  Criss Angel.  Criss Angel is known for his daredevil stunts and his shows in Las Vegas.  Like Houdini, he was also a bit of an escape artist.  He had some tricks that I was not allowed to see at the time because of how graphic they were, but that didn't stop me from buying one of his magic kits.</p>

  <p>I've seen Shin and Colin on America's Got Talent and both of their performances were always mindblowing.  Shin is known for card magic and special effects like the fog.  Colin is known for being a mentalist and the real life Sherlock Holmes.  I was so amazed by their abilites that I actually went to see them live.  Watching these two made me want to learn how to perform cardistry, magic, and the art of illusions/sleight of hand.</p>
