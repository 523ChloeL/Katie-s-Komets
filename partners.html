  <h3>My Heroes- Chloe Lee</h3>
  <p>I have been interested in magic since I was a kid, but where did this come from?  I got my first magic kit around the age of 7, but didn't really get into it until I was 12 years old.  I started out with props, but now I can perform a few magic tricks and can do some cardistry.</p>

  <p>When I was 7, my family and I went to Las Vegas, and one of the more memorable things that happened there was that we went to see  Criss Angel.  Criss Angel is known for his daredevil stunts and his shows in Las Vegas.  Like Houdini, he was also a bit of an escape artist.  He had some tricks that I was not allowed to see at the time because of how graphic they were, but that didn't stop me from buying one of his magic kits.</p>
